# neon ghost - script and VO lines

### Out-of-dialougue voice lines for the Ghost of Magical Girl Mirai

"Wake up!" - quick and stingy ASMR-ish whisper that goes right into the head, like if someone tries to scare you from behind when you don't expect it. It will appear during the dream in Scene 3, and before Rei finds herself in the interrogation room in Scene 7.
"... me ..." - barely audible telepatic call that could be confused with "help me". Appears in Scene 7, Scene 8, and multiple times as Rei explores the building.
"Kill me..." - clearly audible telepatic call that Rei hears when getting close to the Power Plant with access to the terminal.

Search "Mirai: " in the document for all the dialogue lines.


### Setting
Loosesly cyberpunk themed. CorpX is controlling 99% of the power grid, supplying its partners with completely green and almost free electricity. Economy is corporation-centric, and "outsiders", people who does not fit the system, have to survive without its goods and services.

### Characters
* (Magical Girl) Rei, the main character - talented hacker and thief raised by streets, who got caught by CorpX agents during one of her missions. 
* Magical Girl Mirai, support character - once a powerful (maybe even the strongest one) magical girl; evil forces used her kindness against her, turning her into the first power plant many years ago. In the game she is just a ghost, projected by the remainings of her magical powers.
* Boss, side character - thief coordinator, a Rei's commander and father figure. Can be contacted via Rei's communicator (optional hidden item).
* Punk, enemy
* Security agent, enemy
* Security officer, enemy boss
* Demon ghost of the evil army, side character (not sure if we'll be able to include him though) - the one who tricked Mirai and others, and who will try to trick Rei into joining his forces as a Witch

### General game plot
* Rei is assigned with a mission to steal a very important box from CorpX.
* Before going to the mission she sees a dream of stars.
* Rei got caught by agents, who took her into one of the CorpX facilities to interrogate, taking away all her belongings (hacking tools, communicator, etc.)
* Agents detect magical powers in Rei, and they decide to put her through a brainwashing machine to turn her either into a Witch, an obedient tool of evil army, or into a plant ("this facility's plant is long due to replace").
* Rei starts a fight, and know needs to find a way out of this. She can either find a quick route to exit, or explore the facility more to recover her tools, access internal data, check the restricted areas, and find out the truth about CorpX and herself.

### Ending 1 - PANDORA PARADOXXX:
The important item Rei was supposed to steal is a powerful bomb codenamed Pandora Box.
It is stored in one of the locked rooms, and requires a code to be activated.
Code is scattered across the facility on different terminals.
Activating the bomb creates the last game checkpoint and starts the countdown. 
Rei has to escape within the given time, leaving nothing but a destruction behind.

### Ending 2 - Recollect Lines:
Get back all Rei's belongings, contact Boss from the roof (the only place with a signal), steal the internal data from hacked computers, and escape.

### Ending 3 - World Vanquisher:

### Ending 4 - Grievous Lady:
Find a way to the Power Plant, turn it off to release the ghost of Magical Girl Mirai.
Agree to help her destoying the brainwashing machine.
With her help, tranform into a Magical Girl, defeat the remaining secuirty agents and security officer, and do not agree with the Demon Ghost.
Destroy the washing machine with Mirai's help, which will drain the last bits of her magic powers, ceasing her existence.
Escape the facility.

### Ending 5 - Freedome Dive
???? Use the jetpack to escape the building form the roof?? What is the difference from Ending 6??
